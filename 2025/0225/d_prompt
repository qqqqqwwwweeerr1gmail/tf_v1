you are perfectly done the brain job, it can learn to operate its hand automatically.
brain generate 4 vector signal as his will, and 3 vector signal output as command to his hand.
this time. we add another task:
    the option from brain is not only itself , but afect by current state , current state now simply defined as last
output, this time output is no longer output itself , but output from brain add last time output state, therefore,
the brain take action not only by its will but should consider state, make the output fit target vector. add print
input state before the 'brain output'
